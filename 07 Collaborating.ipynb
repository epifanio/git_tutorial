A remote is a copy of the repository that is hosted somewhere else, that we can push to and pull from, and there’s no reason that you have to work with only one. For example, on some large projects you might have your own copy in your own GitHub account (you’d probably call this `origin`) and also the main “upstream” project repository (let’s call this `upstream` for the sake of examples). You would pull from `upstream` from time to time to get the latest updates that other people have committed.\n",
