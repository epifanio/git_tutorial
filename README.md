# git_tutorial
Git tutorial based on jupyter notebooks. 

This tutorial is heavly based on the [git-novice](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) tutorial, from swcarpentry.
The intention here is to keep this resource under a jupyter notebook format so to make easier for the users to add notes, execute code and extend the documentation with code snippets and Git tricks.
